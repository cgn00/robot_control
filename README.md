# CONSTRUCTION OF AN UNMANNED GROUND VEHICLE (UGV). The project use a raspberry pi as a web server to launch a web app to control a vehicle remotly
# Robot Control

This repository contains the code and design files for a robot control system based on the Raspberry Pi and Arduino microcontrollers. The system allows for control of the motors and sensors to enable the robot to move and interact with its environment.

## Installation

To use this system, you will need a Raspberry Pi and an Arduino board and a controller board wich design is available at:. Clone this repository onto your Raspberry Pi and upload the Arduino code to your Arduino board.

## Usage

The robot control system can be used to control a variety of robots, from simple wheeled robots to more complex manipulator arms. The Raspberry Pi serves as the main controller, while the Arduino board handles the low-level motor and sensor control.
